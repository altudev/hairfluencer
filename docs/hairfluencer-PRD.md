One evening, her friend sends a link to Hairfluencer – an app promising instant, AI-powered hairstyle try-ons. Curious, Maya signs up and is greeted by a clean, inviting interface in her native Spanish. She uploads a quick selfie and is instantly wowed by the trendy styles in the gallery.

In just seconds, she’s seeing herself with a chic pixie cut—a look she’d never have dared consider. She marks her favorites and compares them with her current look, feeling a genuine spark of excitement and possibility. No more guesswork, no stress—just a sense of control and fun. After a mini gallery of saved transformations, Maya is finally ready for her next salon visit, confident she’ll love the result.
